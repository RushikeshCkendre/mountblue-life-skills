## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment isn’t always obvious—it can be subtle too. Some examples include:

- **Unwanted advances**: Any kind of physical contact without consent.  
- **Sexual jokes or comments**: Remarks, innuendos, or jokes that make others uncomfortable.  
- **Pressure or coercion**: Using authority or influence to make someone get into sexual act with you.  
- **Personal or sexual questions**: Crossing boundaries with inappropriate conversations.  
- **Sharing explicit content**: Sending or displaying sexual images, videos, or material without consent.  
- **Stalking or online harassment**: Persistent unwanted messages, following, or tracking with a sexual angle.  
- **Invasion of personal space**: Getting too close in a sexual way without permission.  
- **Discrimination**: Treating someone unfairly because of their gender or tying opportunities to sexual favors.

If you ever face or notice harassment, here’s a clear way to act:

1. **Address it directly**: Call it out.  
2. **Document it**: Note dates, times, people involved, and what happened.  
3. **Report it**: Take it to HR, manager, or the official channel in your organization.  
4. **Seek support**: Share with trusted friends, family, or a counselor.  
5. **Know your rights**: Be aware of company policies and legal protections.
