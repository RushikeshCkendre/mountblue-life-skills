# Tiny Habits – Answers (Everyday Talk Style)  

### **Q1. Most interesting story or idea as per video?**  
The thing that stood out the most to me was starting super small—like a habit that literally takes less than 30 seconds. And then actually celebrating it, even if it’s just a fist pump or a smile. Those little wins stack up and make the habit stick without it feeling like a chore.

### **Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.**

### **Q3. Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each habit?**  
Because it makes the habit fun. When you celebrate—even in a small way—it makes you feel good, and your brain starts linking that positive vibe to the habit. That makes you want to do it again the next time.

### **Q4. Most interesting story or idea (personal takeaway)**  
I liked the idea of **temptation bundling**—basically, mix a habit you need with something you actually enjoy. Like only allowing yourself to listen to your favorite podcast when you’re working out. It makes the new habit something to look forward to.

### **Q5. What is the book’s perspective about Identity?**  
The book says it’s better to think about **who you want to be** instead of just what goal you want to hit. Like instead of saying “I want to run a marathon,” you say “I’m a runner.” When you see yourself that way, the habit feels natural.
